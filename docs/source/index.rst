AdjSim Class Documentation
==========================

At its core, AdjSim is an agent-based modelling engine. It allows users to define simulation environments through which agents interact through ability casting and timestep iteration. The framework is targeted towards agents that behave intelligently, for example a bacterium chasing down food. However, the framework is extremely flexible - from enabling physics simulation to defining an environment in which Conway's Game of Life plays out! AdjSim aims to be a foundational architecture on top of which reinforcement learning can be built.
