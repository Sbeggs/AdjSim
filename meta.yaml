  summary: An Agent Based Modelling Engine tailored for Reinforcement Learning.
  description: "At its core, AdjSim is an agent-based modelling engine. It allows users to define simulation environments through which agents\
    \ interact through ability casting and timestep iteration. The framework is targeted towards agents that behave intelligently, for example a bacterium chasing down food. However, the framework is\
    \ extremely flexible - from enabling physics simulation to defining an environment in which `Conway's Game of Life plays out! AdjSim aims\
    \ to be a foundational architecture on top of which reinforcement learning can be built."
