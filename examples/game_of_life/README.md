# Conway's Game Of Life Simulation

This is an implementation of Conway's classic logic game, [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). This example serves to illustrate the flexibility of AdjSim in running Grid-based simulations via the [appropriate simulation index](https://severtopan.github.io/AdjSim/adjsim.html?highlight=perturbative#adjsim.index.GridIndex).

Below we display the two provided simulations, corresponding with different game starting positions: Gosper's Glider Gun, and the Block-Laying Switch Engine.
