# Tag Simulation

This is one of the simplest simulations that can be implemented in AdjSim. It should be used as reference alongside the [tutorial](https://github.com/SeverTopan/AdjSim/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb). In this simulation, agents play a game of tag. The red agent is 'it', and it attemps to tag other agents. The example simulation is non-intelligent (agents choose their actions randomly). For intelligent renditions of the tag simulation, please refer to the afore-mentioned [tutorial](https://github.com/SeverTopan/AdjSim/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).
