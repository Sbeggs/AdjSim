# Orbital Mechanics Simulation

This simulation displays the versatility of the AdjSim framework. Here we simulate the orbital mechanics of the Jupiter moon system, with to-scale constant values for 4 of its moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Real values are used, yet time is sped up to make things more interesting.
