 # Predator-Prey Simulation

This simulation exemplifies [predator-prey relationships](https://globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/predation/predation.html).
The prey photosynthesize their calories while predators must consume prey to survive. This simulation can be taxing on the hardware as its scale is large, and prey can multiply very quickly. If run for long enough, accurate predator-prey graphs can result.
